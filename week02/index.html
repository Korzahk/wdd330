    <ul>
        <li>using the var keyword (or not using a keyword) has global scope and
             shouldn't be done</li>
        <li>const and let have regular block scope</li>
        <li>constants and variables can start with uppercase, lowercase, 
            underscore, or dollar sign. 
            underscores are for private properties and methods</li>
        <li>assigning a variable to an object is by reference</li>
        <li>what is the point of the new keyword?</li>
        <li>string has many meathods for searching 
            and validating its elements</li>
        <li>+ concatenates strings</li>
        <li>backticks allow java script interpolation, 
            e.g. `I will be ${ age + 1 } next year`;</li>
        <li>const mySymbol1 = Symbol('string description of symbol')</li>
        <li>symbols are useful because they prevent duplicates</li>
        <li>const mySymbol2 = Symbol.for('string description of symbol')</li>
            would create a pointer to the same symbol as mySymbol1</li>
        <li>accessing methods of number literals requires 
            an extra decimal point, a space before the dot, 
            or putting the number in parenthesis</li>
        <li>toFixed() for decimals, toPrecision() for scientific notation</li>
        <li>** is ^</li>
        <li>% means remainder, and is only the same as modulus if 
            both operands are non-negative</li>
        <li>Number.isFinite(myNum)</li>
        <li>Transpiling is transforming source code into another language 
            that has a similar level of abstraction</li>
        <li>parseInt(myString) will return the number portions of the string 
            or truncate a decimal. there is a similar paseFloat()</li>
    </ul>
